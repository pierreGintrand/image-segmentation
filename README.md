# Image segmentation

### Computer Vision

Exercise 5.5 from [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications [Richard Szeliski]](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf) :

Mean shift Develop a mean-shift segmentation algorithm for color images (Comaniciu
and Meer 2002).
1. Convert your image to L*a*b* space, or keep the original RGB colors, and augment
them with the pixel (x; y) locations.
2. For every pixel (L; a; b; x; y), compute the weighted mean of its neighbors using either
a unit ball (Epanechnikov kernel) or finite-radius Gaussian, or some other kernel of
your choosing. Weight the color and spatial scales differently,
3. Replace the current value with this weighted mean and iterate until either the motion is
below a threshold or a finite number of steps has been taken.
4. Cluster all final values (modes) that are within a threshold, i.e., find the connected
components. Since each pixel is associated with a final mean-shift (mode) value, this
results in an image segmentation, i.e., each pixel is labeled with its final component.
5. (Optional) Use a random subset of the pixels as starting points and find which component
each unlabeled pixel belongs to, either by finding its nearest neighbor or by
iterating the mean shift until it finds a neighboring track of mean-shift values. Describe
the data structures you use to make this efficient.
6. (Optional) Mean shift divides the kernel density function estimate by the local weighting
to obtain a step size that is guaranteed to converge but may be slow. Use an alternative
step size estimation algorithm from the optimization literature to see if you can
make the algorithm converge faster.
